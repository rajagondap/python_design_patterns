# UML - (Unified Modeling Language)
UML is a good tool to document something as well-defined as design patterns.
Design patterns are well understood and UML communicates their structure very well.

As part fo our design pattern course, we will use UML to visualize two aspects of our learning
1. **Structural Relationships** between Objects in our designs
    
    a. How all Objects are fit together?

    b. What are the relationship between them?

    c. How are they Built?

2. **Behavioural Relationship** between Objects in our design

   a. How the objects behave?
   
   b. How do they communicate with each other?

The end goal is to understand **WHAT** is being done and **HOW** it is accomplished.



**------------------------------------------------------------**


To Illustrate the **Structure** of our design patterns we will use **Class Diagram**.

A Class diagram is used to construct and visualize **object-oriented relationships**.
We use the diagram to capture following information ( Refer the imaged save in the folder)

1. Class information such as 

   a. Attributes

   b. Operations (i.e. Methods)
2. Class Relationships

   a. Generalizations

   b. Associations

   c. Dependencies


**--------------------------------------------**


To Illustrate the **Behaviour** of our design Patterns we will use the **Sequence Diagram**.

A Sequence Diagram is used to visualize **Object-oriented behaviour**. We use it to show 
message exchange over time. We capture the following.

1. Interaction information such as

   a. Actors of Operation

   b. Method Call with data
