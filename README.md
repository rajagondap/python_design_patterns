**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

**OR**

**Design patterns** are associated with good, well-organized software design.
As developers, we are obviously prone to mistakes and sometimes inexperienced decisions.

Think of design patterns as a bag of reusable experience from many generations of coders and software
engineers that we get to use and learn from.

## Design pattern Types

1. **Creational**

    a. Singleton Pattern
    
    b. Factory Method Pattern

    c. Builder Pattern

    d. Prototype

    e. Abstract Factory


2. **Structural**

   a. Adapter Pattern

   b. Bridge Pattern

   c. Composite Pattern

   d. Decoder Pattern

   e. Facade Pattern

   f. Flyweight Pattern

   g. Proxy Pattern


3. **Behavioural**

    a. Strategy Pattern

    b. Observer Pattern

    c. State Design Pattern

   d. Chain Of Responsibility

   e. Command
   
   f. Iterator

   g. Mediator

   h. Memento

   i. Template Method

   j. Visitor


Creational Patterns - Deals with ways of creating Objects or Families of Objects

Structural Patterns - Deals with ways of managing complex objects hierarchies

Behavioural Patterns - Deals with ways of identifying and improving object messaging


## Why we need software Architecture

Complex software systems are plagued with many issues.

1. Timelines are stretched as requirements change.
2. Multiple developers have a hard time coordinating their efforts.
3. Often there is code, redundancy and poor documentation.

This in turn creates issue with maintenance and overall flexibility
for adding new features

In general, poorly designed systems that are hard to maintain, and are not adaptable.

One answer to all the cited problems is having a proper Design and Architecture.

Consider the software Development Life cycle-
1. Requirement- Gather requirement document for UI, UX, and General goals of the project
2. Design - Architect the system based on the requirements( Deployment Docs, Architecture Docs
  ERD, UML, Design Patterns)
3. Implementations - Code and Test the Solution to ensure that it follows the design
and fulfills the requirements( Source code, analytics, Audit, Logs, Tests).

#UML - (Unified Modeling Language)
UML is a good tool to document something as well-defined as design patterns.
Design patterns are well understood and UML communicates their structure very well.
